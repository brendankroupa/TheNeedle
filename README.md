TheNeedle - UB Hackathon Project ðŸ§µ
Overview
---------
TheNeedle is a project created during the University at Buffalo's hackathon as a team effort. This tool allows users to input an article link from their schoolâ€™s database and receive a political lean analysis based on computational linguistics. By leveraging weighted phrasing from CSV files, ThNeedle determines a moderate political bias in the article content, helping users gain a nuanced perspective on potential biases in academic sources.

Features
---------
User-friendly interface for easy link input.
Political bias analysis using computational linguistics techniques.
CSV-based weighting system to interpret article phrasing.
Hackathon Team Project
TheNeedle was built by a team of undergraduate students. This repository is a fork of the original group project, and Iâ€™m grateful to have worked alongside 3 talented teammates who each contributed to making this project possible.

Usage
---------
Simply input an article link from a school database into the ThNeedle UI, and the tool will analyze the content and return a moderate political bias rating based on weighted phrasing.

Acknowledgments
----------
Big thanks to everyone who made this hackathon experience possible and to my teammates for their collaboration and hard work.
